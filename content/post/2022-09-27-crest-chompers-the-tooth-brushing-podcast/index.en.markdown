Chompers - sponsored by Crest Kids and Oral-B -  started out as a series of songs to play during tooth brushing time, and evolved into a twice daily [Spotify podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/21ASCcEXgUlbFSmoqjroZm?si=u0-xuYwyRHay--rf6XhbQQ&nd=1) that is the right length and funny enough to keep kids brushing their teeth. It even reminds kids when to switch quadrants of the mouth. 

When this first started out, the podcast was an Alexa podcast, with an Alexa skill. In 2021 the podcast when exclusively to Spotify and still updated 2x daily.
