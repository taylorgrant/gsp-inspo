For the first time in 33 years, Covid-19 led Oscar Mayer to pull its fleet of Wienermobiles off the road. But per the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/style/inside-oscar-mayer-wienermobile.html), by October 2020, they were back on the road, carrying out their original mission:

> When the Wienermobile made its debut in 1936, the country was still reeling from the Great Depression (it would later be scrapped for metal to aid in war efforts in the 1940s). The original goal was to bring surprise and joy to the people of Chicago, where Oscar Mayer was founded, during those challenging times.

Did not know this, but anyone can request a visit from the Wienermobiles via the Oscar Mayer website. 

> Ms. Swindall thinks the indelible moments of levity her job creates are all the more important this year, when times are tough. “Hearing that the Wienermobile has an impact on people’s lives, in ways that you wouldn’t even imagine, is really cool,” she said.
